## Challenges

This is a very basic app with the exact stack and setup utilized by Smooth Solutions. Some boilerplate has been written to help you get started with the project.

This challenge should be completed within 2 - 5 hours. Please do not spend any more time than this.

1. Complete the GraphQL Query and call the Query to search for 151 Pokemon.

## Things to Note

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Pokemon GraphQL API Reference https://wayfair.github.io/dociql/

Please only use Functional Components and Hooks to complete this challenge.

While this app utilizes TypeScript `noImplicitAny and strictNullChecks` are both set to `False`. TypeScript allows this project to encourage proper typing and modelling of both State and Props in this app.

It is required that the above challenges be completed utilizing Material-UI and Redux.
